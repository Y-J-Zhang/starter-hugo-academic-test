abstract: Given the discovery and hazard of microplastics in freshwater
  environments, the removal of microplastics in drinking water deserves more
  attention. Nevertheless, in the light of existing literature, the
  effectiveness of conventional coagulation on microplastics removal is
  insufficient. Hence, enhanced coagulation is worth being explored. This study
  investigated the improving performance of anionic polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium
  alginate (SA), and activated silicic acid (ASA) when using poly‑aluminum
  chloride (PAC) to remove polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics. The
  experimental results showed that ASA had the highest removal efficiency
  (54.70%) under conventional dosage, while PAM achieved the best removal effect
  (91.45%) at high dosage. Mechanism of coagulation was studied by scanning
  electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR),
  X-ray photoelectron …
