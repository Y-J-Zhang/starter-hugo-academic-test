abstract: Lanthanum-doped sewage sludge-based activated carbon (AC-La), an
  environment-friendly material, can effectively remove fluoride ions from
  water. Regeneration performance of AC-La was mainly studied in this work. The
  results showed that compared to other elution methods, excellent regeneration
  performance of AC-La was achieved by NaOH. AC-La treated with 0.5 mol/L NaOH
  showed a high desorption rate (> 98.5%) and fluorine removal efficiency
  (ca.60%) again. After three NaOH regeneration processes, the regeneration rate
  of AC-La was stable and higher than 73.8%. Characterization proved that NaOH
  caused little impact on pore structure and La loading of the carbon,
  meanwhile, it enhanced ion exchange and electrostatic attraction during F-
  desorption process. The adsorption/desorption mechanism of F- on AC-La were
  attributed to physical action (physical adsorption/desorption and
  electrostatic attraction) and chemical adsorption (inner-sphere complexation,
  ion exchange and chemical precipitation).
